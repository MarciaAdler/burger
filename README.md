# burger

## What the Project Does

This app allows users to add Burgers to a list (and database) and then click a button once they have been devoured (eaten) and moved to a different list. Once on the devoured list, the user has the ability to delete burgers from the database.

## Purpose

The purpose of building this app was to showcase my abilities to use MySQL, Node.js, JQuery, Flex-box, and Handlebars. This was a homework for my coding bootcamp to test my skills in these languages and to see if I could apply them.

## To use the code

To run this code, first clone the respository from github.

<ul>
<li>Once cloned, open the code and run an npm install to install the followering packages:
    <ul>
    <li>express</li>
    <li>express-handlebars</li>
    <li>mysql</li>
    </ul>
</li>

<li>After installing the npm packages, you will need to setup the database to run the code on the backend.  I used MySQL and MySQL Workbench to manage my database.
    <ul>
    <li> You will need to change the password in the config --> connection.js to be your password to your localhost in MySQL workbench.  Also ensure you don't already have a database with the name in the connection.js file.</li>
    </ul>
<li>You should now be able to run the code.  In your terminal run node server.js and the application will run on Port 4000.
</ul>
