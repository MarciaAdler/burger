# burger

## What the Project Does

This app allows users to add Burgers to a list (and database) and then click a button once they have been devoured (eaten) and moved to a different list. Once on the devoured list, the user has the ability to delete burgers from the database.

## Purpose

The purpose of building this app was to showcase my abilities to use MySQL, Node.js, JQuery, Flex-box, and Handlebars. This was a homework for my coding bootcamp to test my skills in these languages and to see if I could apply them.
