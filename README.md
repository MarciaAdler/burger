## What the Project Does

This app allows users to add Burgers to a list (and database) and then click a button once they have been devoured (eaten) and moved to a different list. Once on the devoured list, the user has the ability to delete burgers from the database.

## How users can get started

Users can get started by opening the app and then adding their burgers to the list. once burgers are added users can make them as devoured by clicking the button on the left hand list or delete burgers if they are in the devoured list on the right.

## Maintenance and help

Should users have issues with the site they can reach out to the admin as they maintain the site. Regular reviews of the site and maintenance are performed to ensure functionality.
